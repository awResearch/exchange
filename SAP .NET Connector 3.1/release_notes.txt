Release Notes NCo 3.1.2

* Bugfix: Repository management
  When trying to lookup metadata with a repository, a CommunicationException could occur
  even though the associated destinations are fully functional. This could happen if the
  configuration of the destination currently used for lookups has been modified recently.
  Under certain circumstances it could happen in this case that the destination list is
  not updated properly within the repository.

* Bugfix: tRFC runtime
  A tRFC unit containing more than one function module could not be processed properly
  in the receiving ABAP system. It was actually simply ignored.

* Bugfix: default server configuration implementation with app.config
  In 3.1.1 it was not possible to configure a WebSocket RFC server using the app.config. 
  When providing the WSPORT parameter, the program fails to start with 
  RfcInvalidStateException: No ServerConfiguration defined, which is actually not true, 
  and when checking dev_nco_rfc.log you can find there the exception below:
  System.Configuration.ConfigurationErrorsException: Unrecognized attribute 'WSPORT'

* Bugfix: Log file
  When configuring a traceDirectory in the app.config of an NCo application, still a
  dev_nco_rfc.log file was generated in the working directory, with either the single
  entry that the trace file location has changed or informing about the default/minimal 
  trace level that has been set in the app.config file.

* Bugfix: SapLogonIniConfiguration
  When trying to use SAPUILandscape.xml as basis for destination configurations on a system 
  with a 64-bit SAP Gui installation, NCo was raising an exception similar to
  SAP.Middleware.Connector.RfcInvalidStateException: Unable to find saplogon file
    at SAP.Middleware.Connector.SapLogonIniConfiguration.GetIniFullPath()

* Enhancement: Structure API
  Interface IRfcStructure was enhanced to offer the possibility for a structure to be
  converted to a string and vice versa via the new methods Stringify() and 
  Destringify(string). See API documentation for details.  

* Enhancement: repository metadata handling
  If a datatype is defined as structure, but shall be used as table, an anonymous table type 
  is generated automatically in all cases and not only if such a structure is used for a 
  table parameter.

* Enhancement: decnumber library
  Shared libsapICUdecnumber.dll is replaced with a static equivalent. As a consequence
  associated APIs influencing loading this library have been set to be deprecated and
  do have not any effect anymore.

* Enhancement: integrity
  All assemblies are now signed with authenticode signing.

Release Notes NCo 3.1.1 (GA version)
JCo 3.1 is the successor of JCo 3.0. In note 3152653 you can find the .NET runtimes and
Windows releases, for which the new version is supported. Please note that some releases
have been dropped and that the minimum .NET framework version has been raised to 4.6.2.
NCo 3.1 is supposed to be byte-cod compatible to NCo 3.0 as long as you are not using
methods or fields, that have been set to obsolete in NCo 3.0. Those have been removed
from NCo 3.1. Below you can find alist of the most important new features now supported
with NCo 3.1.

* Support for fast serialization
  The RFC runtime of NCo can now serialize the function module data in the fast
  serialization mode, if the partner system supports that serialization format as well.
  Technically, it is a column-based serialization of the data, which has been shipped
  initially with application server ABAP 7.51 and has been downported later so that also
  older systems benefit from the performance improvements of that serialization. Note
  2372888 describes the ABAP system prerequisites.
  Find more details about the new configuration parameters in the API documentation of
  the class RfcConfigParameters.
* WebSocket RFC communication
  RFC communication is possible also using WebSocket technology instead of the existing
  CPIC based one. The WebSocket RFC communication feature was initially shipped with ABAP
  Platform 1909 (application server ABAP 7.54). Both client and server side communication
  are supported, i.e. NCo calling an ABAP system and an ABAP system is calling NCo via
  WebSocket RFC. The ABAP platform documentation for WebSocket RFC
  (see https://help.sap.com/viewer/753088fc00704d0a80e7fbd6803c8adb/201909.000/en-US/51f1edadb2754e539f6e6335dd1eb4cc.html")
  describes what needs to be done in the ABAP system as a prerequisite, how a destination
  pointing to an NCo WebSocket RFC server needs to be configured in the ABAP system, and
  what are the restrictions.
  Find more details about the new configuration parameters in the API documentation of
  the class RfcConfigParameters.
* CPIC performance improvement in WAN scenarios
  When executing requests in WAN scenarios and exchanging large data amounts, the
  streaming feature of CPIC allows to send data without waiting for acknowledgements for
  each data package. Thus, latency effects and overall execution times are dramatically
  decreased. NCo turns on CPIC streaming automatically, if the partner system supports it
  as well.
* Application Server maintenance support
  For destinations configured for CPIC based communication with load balancing, NCo will
  check regularly which application servers belong to the logon group. If an application 
  server is taken out of the group, e.g. for maintenance purposes, NCo will recognize and 
  after a short time, all connections pointing to this application server will be closed.
  Note: This works only, if the logon group is flagged as "External RFC enabled".

Info about versions 3.1.0.x

3.1.0.x were early versions of JCo 3.1 that were allowed to be used in restricted use
cases only, within a small set of SAP tools, e.g. Analysis Office.
